# Data-Analytics-Project

This project is about the impact COVID has had on the education, health and sociali life of students.
I have used a range of techniques including Excel, Power BI and SQL to gather and present the infomation

 
 About the data:

-	Total students = 1171 in SQL
-	Average age of student = 20
-	Min age = 7
-	Max age = 59
-	Average time spent on self-study = 2.9 hours
-	Average time spent in class = 3.2 hours

Age groups and their highest and lowest ratings

Excellent:

•	Below 18:                59
•	18 – 25:                 26
•	25 and over:             13

Very poor: 

•	Below 18:                47
•	18 – 25:                 344
•	25 and over:             20              


Total time spent on self-study and online class by age – used SUBQUERIES

•	under 18s spent a large amount of time on online classes rather than self-study and a lot of the students spent above the average time in class and on self-study 

•	18-25 overall spent more time on self-study than on online classes (maybe the reason for the high “very poor” rating and around half of students spent just above the average time on online class and just over half of students spent above the average time on self-study

•	Over 25s overall spent equally the same amount of time on self-study and online classes with half of students spending above the average time in class and majority spending above the average time on self-study




Use of medium and rating

•	Smartphone:          533 (46 Excellent) 209 (Very Poor)
•	Laptop/Desktop:   540 (43 Excellent) 179 (Very poor)

Even split of students who used smart phone or laptop however, there were more Very Poor ratings when using a smartphone


Health Issues

•	Under 18s even split of yes and no 
•	18 – 25 majority had no health issues 
•	25 and over majority had no health issues however

•	The largest percentage of students seen an increase in their weight and were having more than 3 meals a day… 



Social Life

•	755 students stated that what they missed the most were usually activities that involved interaction with other people such as “friends, family, colleagues, being able to move freely and places of education”
